# pattern: if k = n-1 -> print in decreasing order in even spaces of array and then from start increasing order to cover the max dist
# from given info
# so if k << n then there will eb multiple possibilities so for that sort the required possible in asc or desc and then do alternate + & -
# better is starting with 1 and then add 1 more to get the 7 in array which gives all the possible ans
